# The Terraform Codex

> **A practical, evolving guide capturing my journey with Terraform through real-world DevOps challenges.**

This repository is my personal knowledge hub, documenting lessons, insights, and hard-earned wisdom from working with Terraform to manage cloud infrastructure. It’s not a polished tutorial — it’s a living collection of notes, best practices, and tools grounded in real-world experience.

## 📁 What's Inside

This codex focuses on testing and validation, with more sections to come as I expand my journey:

### 🧪 Testing & Validation
- [Terratest – Go-based Testing](./Testing/terratest.md)
- [TFLint – Terraform Linting](./Testing/tflint.md)
- [tfsec – Security Scanning](./Testing/tfsec.md)

## 💭 Why This Codex?

I built this codex to capture **what I wish I’d known earlier** — the pitfalls, patterns, and practical solutions I’ve encountered while using Terraform in real projects. It’s a resource for myself and anyone else looking to avoid common mistakes and streamline their IaC workflows.
