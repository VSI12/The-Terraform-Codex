# üîê tfsec ‚Äì Security Scanner for Terraform Code

**tfsec** is a static analysis security scanner for Terraform, designed to identify potential security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in your infrastructure as code (IaC) before deployment. Backed by Aqua Security, it integrates seamlessly into development workflows, offering developer-friendly output and comprehensive checks for secure infrastructure.

## üåü Why tfsec?

- **Deep Security Analysis**: Detects insecure configurations, such as open security groups or hardcoded secrets, using the official HCL parser.
- **Multi-Cloud Support**: Covers AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, DigitalOcean, and provider-agnostic checks.
- **Compliance Checks**: Aligns with standards like CIS Benchmarks, NIST, PCI-DSS, and ISO27001.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Runs efficiently in pipelines with customizable output formats (JSON, CSV, SARIF, etc.).
- **Custom Policies**: Supports user-defined checks via Rego, JSON, or YAML for tailored security rules.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Install tfsec using a package manager or binary:

### Option 1: Homebrew (macOS/Linux)
```bash
brew install tfsec
```

### Option 2: Chocolatey (Windows)
```bash
choco install tfsec
```


Alternatively, download the binary from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/aquasecurity/tfsec/releases).

---


To ignore specific checks, add comments in your Terraform code:
```hcl
resource "aws_security_group_rule" "my-rule" {
  type        = "ingress"
  cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"] #tfsec:ignore:AWS006
}
```

## üí° My Take

tfsec is a must-have for securing Terraform code, offering deep integration with the HCL parser and a rich set of checks that catch issues early. The [official documentation](https://aquasecurity.github.io/tfsec) is a fantastic starting point for mastering its features, while the [Spacelift blog](https://spacelift.io/blog/what-is-tfsec) provides practical insights for real-world use. Pairing tfsec with TFLint and Terratest creates a robust pipeline for secure, reliable infrastructure. Note that tfsec has been integrated into Trivy, which offers additional scanning capabilities, but tfsec remains available for focused Terraform security scanning.[](https://github.com/aquasecurity/tfsec)
