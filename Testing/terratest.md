# 🧪 Terratest – Go-based Infrastructure Testing

**Terratest** is a Go library designed to automate testing of your infrastructure as code, offering robust support for Terraform, Packer, Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP. It enables you to deploy real infrastructure in a test environment, validate its behavior, and clean up afterward, ensuring reliability and correctness before production deployment.

## 🌟 Why Terratest?

- **Real Infrastructure Testing**: Deploys actual resources (e.g., servers, networks) to verify functionality.
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Supports unit, integration, and end-to-end tests with HTTP requests, API calls, SSH connections, and more.
- **Automated Cleanup**: Ensures resources are destroyed post-test to avoid costs.
- **Go-Powered**: Leverages Go’s simplicity and performance for writing tests.
- **Extensible**: Integrates with testing frameworks like Ginkgo and Gomega for enhanced flexibility.

## ⚙️ Installation

To use Terratest, you need Go installed (version ≥1.13). Install the Terratest library with:

```bash
go get github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform
```

Ensure you have Terraform installed and appropriate cloud provider credentials configured (e.g., AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY).

## 🚀 Using Terratest in CI/CD

Integrate Terratest into your CI/CD pipeline for automated infrastructure testing. Below is an example for GitHub Actions:

```yaml
name: Terraform Testing with Terratest
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  terratest:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Go
        uses: actions/setup-go@v5
        with:
          go-version: '1.21'

      - name: Install Terratest Dependencies
        run: go mod init terratest && go get github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform

      - name: Run Terratest
        run: go test -v ./tests
```

Example test file (`tests/main_test.go`):

```go
package test

import (
    "testing"
    "github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform"
    "github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
)

func TestTerraformS3Bucket(t *testing.T) {
    terraformOptions := &terraform.Options{
        TerraformDir: "../",
    }

    defer terraform.Destroy(t, terraformOptions)
    terraform.InitAndApply(t, terraformOptions)

    bucketName := terraform.Output(t, terraformOptions, "bucket_name")
    assert.NotEmpty(t, bucketName)
}
```

## 💡 My Take

Terratest has transformed my approach to infrastructure testing by allowing me to validate real deployments with confidence. Its integration with Go makes tests fast and maintainable, while the official documentation ([terratest.gruntwork.io](https://terratest.gruntwork.io)) provides a clear starting point. The [Spacelift blog post](https://spacelift.io/blog/what-is-terratest) complements this with practical examples, making it easier to adopt Terratest in complex workflows. Pair it with tools like TFLint for a robust testing pipeline.
