# Terraform Testing & Validation

Ensuring the reliability, security, and correctness of your Terraform configurations before they touch production. 
 
This section of the codex is dedicated to the tools and techniques used to test and validate Terraform code. From unit and integration testing to linting and security scanning, these practices are crucial for maintaining high-quality infrastructure as code.  

## 📁 What's Inside
Here you'll find details and insights on various testing and validation methodologies:

### Unit & Integration Testing
**Terratest** – Go-based Integration Testing (link)  
Learn how to write automated tests for your infrastructure using Go, enabling you to spin up real infrastructure and validate its behavior.

### Static Analysis & Linting
**TFLint** – Terraform Linter  ( [view](./tflint.md) )  
A pluggable linter for Terraform that helps catch syntax errors, deprecated features, and cloud-specific mistakes early in the development cycle.

### Validation & Planning
**Validate vs. Plan** – Understanding Infrastructure Changes  
A breakdown of the terraform validate and terraform plan commands, explaining their distinct purposes in ensuring configuration correctness and previewing infrastructure changes.

## Why Test Terraform?
Testing Terraform is vital for:

* **Preventing regressions**: Catching unintended side effects of code changes.
* **Ensuring correctness:** Verifying that your infrastructure behaves as expected.
* **Improving security:** Identifying potential vulnerabilities before deployment.
* **Boosting confidence:** Deploying with greater assurance that your infrastructure will work.
* **Faster feedback loops:** Catching issues early, reducing the cost and time of remediation.
